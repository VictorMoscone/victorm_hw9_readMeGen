All you need to do is run [ node index.js ] in your command line and you'll be good to go! From there, you will be given several prompts to answer that will help populate your wonderful ReadMe file. It's so easy, even a child can do it! Note: The app may open a text editor so that you can enter more precise markdown text.

## Reflection

Creating this app was a weird affair. On the one hand, there were a lot of elements that seemed foreign and confusing to me, while on the other hand, there were a few elements that seemed way too easy. Like almost all assignments before this, I always leave the assignment thinking about all the ways I could have done things differently to achieve a more elegent result.

## Setup Instructions

---

```
1. Clone the repro to your desktop.
2. Right click the folder you just cloned.
3. Click 'Git Bash Here'.
4. Type 'node index.js'.
```
